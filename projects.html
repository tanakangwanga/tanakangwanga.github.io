            <p>The image above shows an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of a database I created in collaboration with 4 other teammates for a made-up restaurant called La Cocina de la Abuela. The database allows the restaurant to keep track of its daily operations, customer data, as well as employee data. Tools such as LucidChart and SQL Server were used in the creation of this database. </p>

            <h3><b>Game of Thrones Quotes WPF </b></h3>
            <p>The image above shows a WPF I created that allows a user to get a random a quote from a Game of Thrones (GOT) character. The quotes are obtained from a website that has all the quotes stored and linked to the character who say them. Json was incorporated in the creation of this WPF to allow a user to export a file that displays all the random they would have generated while interacting with the WPF. </p>

            <p>The above image displays a snapshot of a WPF I created to allow users to sort through video games based on which console the games were released on. After the user selects a specific console, the Listbox is populated with the corresponding  as shown in the image. If a user wants to obtain more information about a specific game, they can click on it and it's information pops up in a window which is shown as the "InfoWindow" in the image above. </p>
